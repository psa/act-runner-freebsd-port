FreeBSD does not support Docker.
When configuring the runner, use 'host' as the label. e.g.
act-runner register --labels FreeBSD:host,FreeBSD-14.0:host

If you have a labels configuration section in your
/usr/local/etc/act-runner.conf then ensure that references to docker have been
removed from it.
